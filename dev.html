<h3>I am brand new to web development or anytype of coding. Ref-code is where I started my first lesson. <br>Learning HTML and CSS.
  It is tough for me but I hope I will get it.<br>I have begun to figure out that coding is what makes tyhe internet and every website 
  is very carefully coded. HTML is my first lesson. I am using HTML on atom app to code and my site will be hosted on Github.</h3>
